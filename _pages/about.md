Hello! I’m Hao Zheng, a fourth-year Ph.D. student in the School of Computer Science and Engineering at Central South University, supervised by Prof. Zhigang Hu. Currently, I’m also a visiting researcher at Western University, where I work under the guidance of Prof. Boyu Wang. My research interests lie in Personalized Federated Learning and Multi-feature Fusion.

Before starting my Ph.D., I completed my Master’s degree at Central South University and earned my Bachelor’s degree at Taiyuan University of Technology.
<!--Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
