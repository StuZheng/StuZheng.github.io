Hello! I’m Hao Zheng, a fourth-year Ph.D. student in the School of Computer Science and Engineering at Central South University, supervised by Prof. Zhigang Hu. Currently, I’m also a visiting researcher at Western University, where I work under the guidance of Prof. <a href='https://sites.google.com/site/borriewang/'>Boyu Wang</a> and Prof. <a href='https://www.csd.uwo.ca/~xling/'>Charles Ling</a>. My research interests lie in Personalized Federated Learning and Multi-feature Fusion.

Before starting my Ph.D., I completed my Master’s degree at Central South University in 2021 and earned my Bachelor’s degree at Taiyuan University of Technology in 2018.
